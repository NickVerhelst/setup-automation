# src

In the src folder we collect all powershell modules that are used in the main script of the installer.

There are utility modules for:
- Reading and parsing the txt configs `read-configs.psm1`.
- Installing packages via Chocolatey `install-choco-packages.psm1`.
- Installing packages via Microsoft Store `install-microsoft-store-packages.psm1`
